# Predicting Algerian Forest Fires - Regression Analysis

## Overview 
Performed regression and classification analyses to identify key environmental factors influencing forest fires in the Bejaia region of Algeria.

## Data & Methods
- Conducted exploratory data analysis on a subset of the Algerian Forest Fires Dataset (measures daily weather conditions from June to September 2012) and formulated hypotheses
- Predicted BUI using DMC and DC with multiple linear regression; evaluated model with MSE and R^2 (~0.995) metrics, confirming strong linear relationships
- Classified fire occurence using all weather features with logistic regression, then applied lasso regularization for feature selection, identifying the most predictive factors (temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, fine fuel MC, duff MC, drought code, fire weather index)

## Key Insights
- BUI is highly influenced by DMC and DC
- Not all weather features are necessary to predict fire occurence; performing logistic regression with only the most predictive factors yields a perfect model with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score error metrics all equal to 1.

# Outcome
Generated predictive models for fire severity (BUI) and occurence with interpretable coefficients. Demonstrated workflow from data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, regression, feature selection, to model evaluation.

# Tools
Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
